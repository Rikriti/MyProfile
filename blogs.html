        <h2>Building an Exercise Detection and Correction System: From Data Woes to Real-Time Performance üöÄ</h2>
        <img src="/images/exercise-detection.png" alt="Exercise Detection Image">
        <p><strong>Published on:</strong> November 1, 2024</p>
        <p>
            When I first set out to develop an exercise detection and correction system, I had no idea how challenging, yet rewarding, the journey would be. The goal was clear: to create a system that could detect exercise reps, assess form, and provide real-time feedback to help users improve their fitness routines. But, as anyone who‚Äôs ventured into machine learning will tell you, things rarely go as planned‚Äîat least not right away.
        </p>
        <h3>The Dataset Dilemma üìâ</h3>
        <p>
            The initial hurdle we encountered was the dataset. As much as I wanted to dive into the coding and modeling, I first had to collect the necessary data. But there was a catch: the dataset was insufficient. The limited number of labeled exercise videos made it hard to train an effective model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite these limitations, we proceeded with training two different machine learning models: Random Forest and LSTM with Attention. The results? Let‚Äôs just say they weren‚Äôt exactly what we had hoped for.
        </p>
        <h3>The First Attempt: Random Forest and LSTM with Attention</h3>
        <p>
            We first trained a Random Forest model and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with Attention model. The training accuracy for the LSTM model hit an eye-popping 100%. Sounds great, right? Not exactly. This perfect score was likely due to overfitting‚Äîwhere the model had memorized the training data, including noise, rather than learning generalizable patterns. When we tested the model, it performed poorly, with an accuracy of around 30%.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Random Forest model didn‚Äôt fare much better. The training accuracy was 69%, but the testing accuracy only reached 52%, which was far from ideal.
        </p>
        <h3>The Turning Point: Simplifying the Approach üõ†Ô∏è</h3>
        <p>
            Not willing to give up, we reassessed our approach. Instead of complicating things with Attention layers, we focused on a simpler LSTM model, which didn‚Äôt include the extra input layers. This change proved to be a game-changer. The training accuracy improved significantly to 87%, and the testing accuracy reached around 72%.
        </p>
        <p>
            While these results were far from perfect, they represented a major step forward. We knew we were on the right track, but there was still a long road ahead.
        </p>
        <h3>The Real-Time Challenge: UI and Camera Lag üìπ</h3>
        <p>
            Another challenge we faced was the user interface (UI) and real-time detection. Building an engaging and efficient UI for real-time detection is no easy feat. The system required seamless integration between the model, UI, and camera to provide live feedback to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, camera lag and inefficient performance became major roadblocks. The delay in capturing and processing frames impacted the system‚Äôs responsiveness, making it difficult to provide real-time feedback without noticeable lag. Optimizing this aspect of the system took longer than expected, but it was clear that it was essential for user satisfaction.
        </p>
        <h3>The Tools Behind the Magic üîß</h3>
        <p>
            This journey wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the powerful Python tools at our disposal. Here‚Äôs a rundown of the key libraries and frameworks that made it all come together:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TensorFlow & Keras:</strong> For building and training the machine learning models. The LSTM architecture was implemented using Keras, which provided a flexible framework for developing deep learning models.</li>
            <li><strong>scikit-learn:</strong> Used for implementing the Random Forest model and conducting basic machine learning tasks such as splitting the dataset and evaluating performance.</li>
            <li><strong>NumPy:</strong> For data manipulation and working with the large sets of exercise video frames.</li>
            <li><strong>OpenCV:</strong> Utilized for real-time video capture and frame processing. OpenCV is essential for handling the camera feed and ensuring smooth integration with the detection system.</li>
            <li><strong>Flask:</strong> Used for building a simple API that connects the model to the front-end user interface, making it easier to integrate the machine learning models with the real-time UI.</li>
            <li><strong>Matplotlib & Seaborn:</strong> These libraries were indispensable for visualizing the model‚Äôs performance, training curves, and other important metrics.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>A Work in Progress: The Road Ahead üöß</h3>
        <p>
            After months of trials, sleepless nights, and countless cups of coffee, we‚Äôve made significant strides in developing our exercise detection system. However, our work is far from complete. While we‚Äôve achieved encouraging results in counting reps, detecting form errors, and providing corrective feedback, the system is still a work in progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            We‚Äôre currently fine-tuning the model to improve its real-time performance and accuracy across different exercises and user conditions. Our goal is to create a balanced solution that not only works well in controlled environments but also adapts seamlessly to real-world scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
            The journey is ongoing, with plenty of challenges still ahead. But each step brings us closer to building a reliable ML-based fitness companion. Stay tuned as we continue refining our system to turn this vision into reality! üöÄ
